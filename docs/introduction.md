  Frosti is your virtual cloud assistant.

Frosti is a developer platform that automatically provisions, manages, and optimizes cloud infrastructure by inferring requirements from your application code.

Just use the Azure, AWS, or GCP Sdks. Our developer platform will automatically provision the most secure, reliable and cost optimized cloud infrastructure based on the Sdks used. Don't worry about networking or load management. Frosti will know when to deploy architecture that's not obvious from the Sdks.
