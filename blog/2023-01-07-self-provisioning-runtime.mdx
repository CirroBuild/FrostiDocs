Today we'll explore the emerging trend of "Self Provisiong Runtimes" or "Infrastructure from Code".

  "If the Platonic ideal of Developer Experience is a world where you ”Just Write Business Logic”, 
  the logical endgame is a language+infrastructure combination that figures out everything else...

  Advancements in two fields — programming languages and cloud infrastructure — will converge in a
  single paradigm: where all resources required by a program will be automatically provisioned, 
  and optimized, by the environment that runs it."

## The World Today

The world of modern devops has seen an explosion of new responsibilities for the software developer.
Let's look at the list of tasks required to build an application on the cloud.
First, you must evaluate the ever growing list of services offered by the cloud providers 
to select the services that are usable, cost efficient and performant for your use case. 
Then you'll have to learn the best practices for configuring the resource for modern security standards and BCDR best practices.
Next you will probably try to provision the resource, fail 3 times in the process and spend hours debugging JSON
files and random permissions errors. And we haven't even started on the application code. This is clearly 
both unsustainable and a significant time sink for a series of tasks that are not unique to your business.

## The New Paradigm

Luckily for developers everywhere there is a new industry trend towards a "self provisioning
runtime". 

As is always the trend in the software industry, when a set of programming tasks reaches a sufficient level of
complexity and repeatability, an abstraction layer is added to improve productivity.
For example, memory management used to be a task that fell on programmers. It was tricky and error prone leading 
to many security and reliability risks. Eventually, storage became cheap enough (and enough keyboards were hurled against the wall
debugging seg faults) that a new paradigm developed where programming languages handled memory management for you. 
A similar shift is occuring in the world of cloud provisioning. 
Repeatable tasks such as provisioning storage or dbs for the application can 
be abstracted away from the developer, creating a more reliable and secure stack.

A self provisioning run time evaluates the program and provisions the necessary infrastructure via static 
analysis of the application itself. For example, if you write:

```csharp title="C#"
// Container reference with creation if it does not alredy exist

Container container = await database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync(
    id: "products",
    partitionKeyPath: "/categoryId",
    throughput: 400
);

Console.WriteLine($"New container:\t{container.Id}");
```

It can be inferred that a Cosmos Db Account needs to be provisioned in the users Azure subscription.

## Our Approach

Here at Frosti we believe that developers should be able to benefit from the self provisioning 
framework without adopting a new set of SDKs. Whereas most start ups are developing their own custom 
sdks to be used in the application code, we encourage businesses to simply continue using the cloud
provider SDKs. Frosti will study the call patterns and automatically 
provision and configure the underlying infrastructure for test, pre - production or a production environment.
