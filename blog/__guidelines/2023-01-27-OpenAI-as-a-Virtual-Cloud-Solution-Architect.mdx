Today we'll have some fun exploring ChatGPT and testing its knowledge of 
cloud application best practices.

Getting started with a cloud project can be a very daunting task, especially for a developer
new to the cloud. Most large enterprises spend significant money on Cloud Solution Architects to advise them on the best patterns 
and to build starter PoC's demonstrating key functionality. Unfortunately, most companies are not large enough
to warrant a Microsoft account team or have the budget for a consulting firm to provide this assistance.

This led me to wonder, what can ChatGPT do to help small and medium enterprises launch their first 
cloud applications?

## A Cloud Solution Conversation with Chat GPT

I started my conversation with ChatGPT with a simple prompt describing my use case: 

> Me: I have an IoT sensor and I want to stream the data to databricks using Azure resources. 
  What architecture do I need for a proof of concept?
  
> ChatGPT: 
  There are a few different ways you could set up an architecture to stream data from an IoT 
  sensor to Databricks using Azure resources, but one possible proof of concept architecture might
  involve the following components:
> 
  IoT Device: This could be a sensor or other device that generates data and is capable of sending 
  that data over the internet.
> 
  IoT Hub: Azure IoT Hub is a fully managed service that enables secure and reliable bi-directional
  communications between millions of IoT devices and a solution back-end. You could use IoT Hub as 
  a message broker to receive data from your IoT device and route it to other services.
> 
  Event Hub: Azure Event Hubs is a fully managed, real-time data ingestion service that's designed 
  for high-throughput and low-latency ingress of data from thousands of devices. You could use Event
  Hubs as a buffer to store the data coming from IoT Hub before it gets processed by Databricks...

I was pretty happy with this first response. But then I ran into my first hurdle: 

> Me: Can you provide me an arm template of that infrastructure?

> ChatGPT: I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to create an ARM template for you...

However, by reframing my question I was able to later have it generate the ARM template, sampled below: 

```
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "parameters": {
        "eventHubName": {
            "type": "string",
            "metadata": {
                "description": "The name of the Event Hub to be created."
            }
        },
        "fileSystemName": {
            "type": "string",
            "metadata": {
                "description": "The name of the Data Lake Storage File System to be created."
            }
        },
        "functionAppName": {
            "type": "string",
            "metadata": {
                "description": "The name of the Function App to be created."
            }
        }
    }
```

I was curious if ChatGPT could provide me with a starter application. Typically I spend a significant 
amount of time finding the right quick starts and tutorials then adapting the code samples to my use case.

> Me: Can you give me an example application to read from an eventhub and write to azure data lake in .NET?

> ChatGPT:
Sure, here's an example of how you might read data from an Azure Event Hub and write it to Azure Data Lake Storage using 
the .NET SDK for Event Hubs and the Azure Data Lake Storage .NET library:

```csharp title="C#"

using Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs;
using Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs.Processor;
using Microsoft.Azure.Storage;
using Microsoft.Azure.Storage.DataLake.Store;
using System;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Connect to the Event Hub
        var connectionString = "<your-event-hub-connection-string>";
        var eventHubName = "<your-event-hub-name>";
        var eventHubClient = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString, eventHubName);
        var partitionReceiver = eventHubClient.CreateReceiver("<consumer-group-name>", "<partition-id>", EventPosition.FromEnqueuedTime(DateTime.Now));

        // Connect to the Data Lake Storage
        var storageConnectionString = "<your-storage-connection-string>";
        var storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(storageConnectionString);
        var dataLakeStoreAccount = new DataLakeStoreAccount(storageAccount.Credentials, storageAccount.BlobEndpoint);
        var fileSystemClient = dataLakeStoreAccount.CreateFileSystemClient();

        // Receive and process events
        while (true)
        {
            var events = await partitionReceiver.ReceiveAsync(100);
            if (events == null) continue;

            foreach (var eventData in events)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Received event data: {Encoding.UTF8.GetString(eventData.Body.Array)}");

                // Write the event data to the Data Lake Storage
                var filePath = "<your-file-path>";
                using (var file = fileSystemClient.CreateFile(filePath, IfExists.Append))
                {
                    file.Write(eventData.Body.Array);
                }
            }
        }

        // Close the connection to the Event Hub
        await eventHubClient.CloseAsync();
    }
}
```

I was blown away by this response but it also showed the shortcomings of ChatGPT. It correctly identified 
the sdks I needed and provided a reasonably correct sample application. On the other hand, it was riddled with 
bad practices such as storing connection strings in code.

## Conclusion

I think ChatGPT has incredible promise in the future as a tool for developers to understand 
the right cloud architectures and potentially even analyze their existing deployments. It's incredibly natural
to have a continuous natural language conversation rather than searching the cloud providers
docs for the right key words. It's still far from being a trusted source of truth, but I believe it could
show value in the near term if it is constrained to a set of cloud provider approved samples and docs.
